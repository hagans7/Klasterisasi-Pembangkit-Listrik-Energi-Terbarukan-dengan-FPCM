# Project Description
Clustering renewable power plants in each country in the world to see the distribution of development in each country to support the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to realize affordable, clean and sustainable energy for all. There are 3 clusterings, namely low, medium and high. uses two algorithms, namely the manual algorithm and the FPCM library algorithm. The two approaches produce slightly different output.

# Dataset Overview
This data comes from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) is an intergovernmental organization that supports countries in their transition to a sustainable energy future, and serves as the principal platform for international co-operation, a center of excellence, and a repository of policy, technology, resources . with samples from 78 countries taken in 2022 spread from Asia, Europe to America. The four data features that are parameters for each country are renewable power plants, namely hydro and marine, solar, wind and bioenergy plants in GWh (gigawatt-hour) units.
